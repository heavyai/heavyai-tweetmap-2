# OmniSci Tweetmap V2


**Note** that the above script will install several libraries as `git submodules` in `./lib`. This requires that you have configured an [SSH connection with Github](https://help.github.com/articles/testing-your-ssh-connection/), so that `git clone` may use `ssh` and not `https`.


This is OmniSci's Tweetmap demo. Use it as an example for building custom visualizations with our open source libraries:
* [MapD Charting](https://github.com/mapd/mapd-charting)
* [MapD CrossFilter](https://github.com/mapd/mapd-crossfilter)
* [MapD Connector](https://github.com/mapd/mapd-connector)
